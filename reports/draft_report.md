# Draft Report: E-commerce Cart Abandonment Prediction

## 1. Introduction
This project explores the application of supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of online shopping cart abandonment. The project aims to identify patterns in user behavior and provide actionable insights to improve e-commerce conversion rates.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
### Objective
To predict whether a user will abandon their cart using features such as:
- Cart contents (e.g., product categories and quantities)
- Payment method
- Purchase history

### Problem Type
This is a **binary classification problem**:
- Labels: `Cart Abandoned` (1) / `Not Abandoned` (0).

---

## 3. Dataset
### Features
- **Cart Contents**: Encoded categories of products in the cart.
- **Payment Method**: Categorical variable representing payment preferences.
- **Purchase History**: Numeric summary of user's prior purchases.

### Preprocessing
- Handle missing data (e.g., imputation).
- Normalize numeric features.
- Encode categorical features.
- Split dataset into train/test sets (80/20).

## 4. Algorithms
We use two supervised learning algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression: A baseline algorithm for binary classification.
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A distance-based classification model.

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision**: Ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Ratio of true positives to all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualization of classification performance.
